**Hello Friends**

## What is this?


**Now compatible with iOS 13 with Dark Mode**
THIS IS A TOOL FOR TWEAK DEVELOPERS!! This is an implementation of FLEX for iOS 12 RootlessJB. The tweak [[FLEXing]] by NSExceptional (https://github.com/NSExceptional/FLEXing) is awesome, ~~but unfortunately Activator has not been updated for iOS 12 RootlessJB~~ **I have come to learn there is a branch of FLEXing that does not use activator, and should be compatible with iOS 12**. This is a very simple implementation that allows you to toggle FLEX from ~~the home screen or lockscreen~~ ANYWHERE by force-touching or long-pressing the status bar. You can also use this while the phone is locked (toggle this option in the settings).

## How does this work?

Force-Touch or Long-Press (2 seconds) the status bar. ~~Does not work in apps yet because of sandboxing limitations of RootlessJB.~~ Works everywhere. 

## How do I install this?

Compile with theos, inject debs how you normally would for RootlessJB. This will also work with a package manager once one gets updated.

## Can I contribute?

yep, just do yourself a fork :)

## Are there settings with a nice little icon?

of course
